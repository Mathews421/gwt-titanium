/**
 * The Titanium binding of [Application
 * Resources](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/index.html).
 * This gives you access to resources you have packaged for your own
 * application. If you want to access the system-wide Android `R`, use
 * {@link org.urish.gwtit.titanium.Android.R}.
 * <p>
 * Notes: These properties and sub-properties are queried directly against your
 * Application's `R` class, and should have the same syntax. For example, if you
 * have a file `platform/android/res/drawable/icon.png` in your project, you
 * could then access its integer id like this:
 * 
 * var resid = Titanium.App.Android.R.drawable.icon;
 * 
 * @platforms android
 * @since 1.5
